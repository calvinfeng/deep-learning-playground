## PyTorch Details

- Use `view` (in PyTorch) or `reshape` (in numpy) to change the shape of the data without changing
  the order of the axes. `view` requires that Tensor is contiguous.
- Use `permute` (in PyTorch) or `transpose`/`swapaxes` (in numpy) to rearrange the axes of your
  data.

## PyTorch Questions

- What's the difference between size and shape?
